<h1> ABOUT VISHAKAPATANAM</h1>
<P1>Visakhapatnam, formerly known as Vizagapatam (also known as Vizag, Viśākha or Wāltair) is the largest and most populous city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, and its proposed administrative capital.
It is between the Eastern Ghats and the coast of the Bay of Bengal. It is the second-largest city on the east coast of India after Chennai, and the fourth-largest in South India.</P1>
<h2> HISTORY OF VISHAKAPATANAM</h2>
<P1>Visakhapatnam's history began in the 6th century BCE, when it was considered part of the Kalinga Kingdom, and later ruled by the Vengi, the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties. Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries, with its control alternating between the Chola dynasty and the Gajapati Kingdom, until its conquest by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century.In the 16th century, after the decline of the Vijayanagara empire and the Gajapatis, the coastal region of North Andhra, including Visakhapatnam, was annexed by the Jeypore Kingdom and remained part of it until the arrival of the British in 1711. Evidently, the Maharaja of Jeypore was commonly referred to as the Maharaja of Visakhapatnam until the dissolution of the princely state in 1947. European powers eventually established trade operations in the city, and by the end of the 18th century it had come under French colonial rule. Control passed to the East India Company in 1804 and it remained under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947.</P1>
